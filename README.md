# CS 2820 - Sprint 1

### Jeff Bates
- Responsible for writing and updating the README.md file, outlining the high-level plan and status.

### Cooper Fort
- Focused on creating the UML Sequence Diagram that shows the program flow starting from the Warp processing the 'ra' option.
- Used sequencediagram.org to create the diagram.
- Ensured that the diagram clearly shows the sequence of interactions between program components.

### Colin Miller
- Worked closely with the sequence diagram designer to understand and implement the program logic for processing the 'ra' option in the Warp program.
- Assisted in writing pseudocode snippets for testing and implementing the 'ra' option.
- Documented methods and flow in the README documents as needed.

### Yash Bandla
- Wrote the testing and documentation plan to ensure a clear approach for validating the project.

### Graham Besser
- Created a class diagram and a project plan that lists tasks in order.
- Described key methods for the Visualization class.

# CS 2820 Sprint2

##Jeff Bates
-Created JUnit Tests to test edge cases for all the methods in ReliabilityVisualization to ensure stability
- Tests for the following methods were created: 

##Cooper Fort
-Updated sequencediagram.org with the new methods and added the diagram to ARTIFACTS folder
-Method calls that were updated: ReliabilityVisualization.getReliabilities, WorkLoad.getFlowNamesInPriorityOrder, WorkLoad.getNodesInFlow, createHeader, createColumnHeader, createVisualizationData, and saveVisualization

##Colin Miller
-

##Yash Bandla
-Responsible for updating the README.md file with high-level plans for updating ReliabilityVisualization with working code
-Clearly outlined everyone’s tasks and explained all artifacts

##Graham Besser
-Created JavaDoc comments and updated documentation files to show each method’s function and parameters in a high level manner

##ARTIFACTS
-Updated CS2820_Project ToDo with Sprint 2 tasks that need to be completed by every team member
-Created Sprint 2.pdf to show plans for staying organized, how we will complete every task, and modifications to UML Sequence/Model Diagrams and ReliabilityVisualization code
-Created a new WARP Sequence Diagram (titled WARP Diagram V2.jpg) that shows updated flow of all code (post ReliabilityVisualization code changes) in WARP codebase
